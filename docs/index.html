<h1>Hi, I’m Kim.</h1>
<article>
  <p>
    I currently work as a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.bravecare.com">Brave Care</a>, where I’m part of a team of driven, considerate, and talented engineers building technology that supports multiple pediatric clinics and tools used by families across the U.S. Throughtout my tenure, I’ve taken on a number of different roles, including a year-long stint as an engineering manager. I’m back on the individual contributer side of the <a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">engineer/manager pendulum</a>, finding statisfaction with writing passing tests and solving problems across the stack.

    Previously, I worked as a software developer at <a href="https://secure.actblue.com">ActBlue</a>, an online fundraising platform. While there, I focused on improving the donation experience with a combination of product knowledge, hypothesis testing, and technical skills. I also enjoy visualizing data and riding bicycles.
