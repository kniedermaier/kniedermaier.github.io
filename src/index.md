  <p>
    I currently work as an engineering manager at <a href="https://www.bravecare.com">Brave Care</a>, where I do my best to help a team of driven, considerate, and talented engineers build technology that supports multiple pediatric clinics and tools used by families across the U.S.

    Previously, I worked as a software developer at <a href="https://secure.actblue.com">ActBlue</a>, an online fundraising platform, focusing on improving the donation experience with a combination of product knowledge, hypothesis testing, and technical skills. I also enjoy visualizing data and riding bicycles. Feel free to get in touch by <a href="mailto:hello@kimniedermaier.com?subject=Hi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a>.
