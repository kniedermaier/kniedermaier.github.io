  <p>
    I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/">Nava</a>, a public benefit corporation with a mission to make government services simple, effective, and accessible to all. I’m a big fan of collaborating with designers and user researchers to ensure a website’s experience lives up to those ideals.

    Previously, I was both an engineering manager and software engineer at <a href="https://www.bravecare.com">Brave Care</a>, helping to build technology that supported multiple pediatric clinics and tools used by families across the U.S. And before that, I worked as software developer at <a href="https://secure.actblue.com">ActBlue</a>, an online fundraising platform. While there, I focused on improving the donation experience with a combination of product knowledge, hypothesis testing, and technical skills.

    In my free time, I’m an avid reader and hiker, enjoy riding bicycles, and love to dip my toes into new-to-me hobbies like photography, carpentry, and birding. Feel free to get in touch by <a href="mailto:hello@kimniedermaier.com?subject=Hi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a>.
