    I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.bravecare.com">Brave Care</a>, where I'm part of a team of driven, considerate, and talented engineers building technology that supports multiple pediatric clinics and tools used by families across the U.S. Throughtout my tenure, I've taken an array of roles, including a year-long stint as an engineering manager. I'm back on the individual contributer side of the <a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">engineer/manager pendulum</a>, finding statisfaction with writing passing tests and solving problems across the stack.

    Previously, I worked as a software developer at <a href="https://secure.actblue.com">ActBlue</a>, an online fundraising platform, focusing on improving the donation experience with a combination of product knowledge, hypothesis testing, and technical skills. I also enjoy visualizing data and riding bicycles. Feel free to get in touch by <a href="mailto:hello@kimniedermaier.com?subject=Hi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a>.
